<p>The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
<p>(a) California is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and research through companies large and small and through the state’s remarkable public and private universities.</p>
<p>(b) Artificial intelligence, including new advances in foundation models, has the potential to catalyze innovation and the rapid development of a wide range of benefits for Californians and the California economy, including advances in medicine, wildfire forecasting and prevention, and climate science, and to push the bounds of human creativity and capacity.</p>
<p>(c) The <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_7378d94e">Joint California Policy Working Group</span> on AI Frontier Models has recommended sound principles for policy in artificial intelligence.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_7378d94e" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This refers to a group of AI experts <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advance-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/" target="_blank">convened</a> by Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2024 to study how California should govern frontier AI. The Working Group was led by Stanford HAI co-director <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/people/fei-fei-li" target="_blank">Fei-Fei Li</a>, Carnegie Endowment president <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/people/mariano-florentino-tino-cuellar?lang=en" target="_blank">Tino Cuéllar</a>, and UC Berkeley professor <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/people/jennifer-chayes" target="_blank">Jennifer Chayes</a>. They published their findings in June 2025 as the <a href="https://www.cafrontieraigov.org/" target="_blank">California Report on Frontier AI Policy.</a><br><br>SB 53's content draws heavily upon the California Report's recommendations, <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wiener-expands-ai-bill-landmark-transparency-measure-based-recommendations-governors" target="_blank">as noted</a> by the bill's author, Senator Scott Wiener.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(d) Targeted interventions to support effective artificial intelligence governance should balance the technology’s benefits and the potential for material risks.</p>
<p>(e) In building a robust and transparent evidence environment, policymakers can align incentives to simultaneously protect consumers, leverage industry expertise, and recognize leading safety practices.</p>
<p>(f) As industry actors conduct internal research on their technologies’ impacts, public trust in these technologies would significantly benefit from access to information regarding, and increased awareness of, frontier AI capabilities.</p>
<p>(g) Greater transparency can also advance accountability, competition, and public trust.</p>
<p>(h) Whistleblower protections and public-facing information sharing are key instruments to increase transparency.</p>
<p>(i) Incident reporting systems enable monitoring of the post-deployment impacts of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>(j) Unless they are developed with careful diligence and reasonable precaution, there is concern that advanced artificial intelligence systems could have capabilities that <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_cbf73da0">pose catastrophic risks</span> from both malicious uses and malfunctions, including artificial intelligence-enabled hacking, biological attacks, and loss of control.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_cbf73da0" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">For an overview of the evidence that advanced AI could pose catastrophic risks, see §2 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025/international-ai-safety-report-2025#risks" target="_blank">International AI Safety Report</a>.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(k) With the frontier of artificial intelligence rapidly evolving, there is a need for legislation to track the frontier of artificial intelligence research and alert policymakers and the public to serious risks and harms from the very most advanced artificial intelligence systems, while avoiding burdening smaller companies behind the frontier.</p>
<p>(l) While the major artificial intelligence developers have already <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_0595112e">voluntarily established</span> the creation, use, and publication of frontier AI frameworks as an industry best practice, not all developers are providing reporting that is consistent and sufficient to ensure necessary transparency and protection of the public. Mandatory, standardized, and objective reporting by frontier developers is required to provide the government and the public with timely and accurate information.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_0595112e" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body"><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/rsp-updates" target="_blank">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/updating-our-preparedness-framework/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/strengthening-our-frontier-safety-framework/" target="_blank">Google DeepMind</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/meta-frontier-ai-framework/?utm<em>source=newsroom&utm</em>medium=web&utm<em>content=Frontier</em>AI<em>Framework</em>PDF&utm<em>campaign=Our</em>Approach<em>to</em>Frontier<em>AI</em>blog" target="_blank">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://data.x.ai/2025-08-20-xai-risk-management-framework.pdf" target="_blank">xAI</a> have all voluntarily published and committed to follow frontier AI frameworks (also known as safety policies). No two companies' frameworks are exactly alike, but they do share some <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-26-common-elements-of-frontier-ai-safety-policies/" target="_blank">common elements</a>. All frontier AI frameworks identify potentially dangerous AI capabilities, such as WMD engineering, autonomous AI R&D, persuasion, and offensive cyber capabilities. The frameworks explain how AI companies estimate their models' dangerous capabilities and how they prevent their systems from using those capabilities to cause harm.<br><br>§22757.12.a of SB 53 requires every large frontier developer to publish a frontier AI framework. The required elements of these frameworks are broadly in line with the elements of AI companies' voluntarily established safety policies.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(m) Timely reporting of critical safety incidents to the government is essential to ensure that public authorities are promptly informed of ongoing and emerging risks to public safety. This reporting enables the government to monitor, assess, and respond effectively in the event that advanced capabilities emerge in frontier artificial intelligence models that may pose a threat to the public.</p>
<p>(n) In the future, foundation models developed by <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_afe5e4b2">smaller companies or that are behind the frontier</span> may pose significant catastrophic risk, and additional legislation may be needed at that time.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_afe5e4b2" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">A key reason why companies behind the frontier could eventually pose catastrophic risk is algorithmic progress. Every year, machine learning researchers discover new ways to make their learning algorithms more efficient, allowing them to train a model with a given level of performance using fewer FLOPs than previously would have been needed. Epoch AI have estimated the rate of algorithmic progress for language models, and <a href="https://epoch.ai/blog/algorithmic-progress-in-language-models" target="_blank">they find</a> that from 2012 to 2023, the FLOPs required to achieve some fixed level of performance halved every eight months. If this trend holds, a model that takes 10^26 FLOPs to train now will take two orders of magnitude fewer FLOPs in five years.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(o) The recent release of the Governor’s California Report on Frontier AI Policy and testimony from legislative hearings on artificial intelligence before the Legislature reflect the advances in AI model capabilities that could pose potential catastrophic risk in frontier artificial intelligence, which this act aims to address.</p>
<p>(p) It is the intent of the Legislature to create more transparency, but collective safety will depend in part on frontier developers taking due care in their development and deployment of frontier models proportional to the scale of the foreseeable risks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Before, or concurrently with, deploying a new frontier model or a substantially modified version of an existing frontier model, a large frontier developer shall include in the transparency report required by paragraph (1) summaries of all of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Assessments of catastrophic risks from the frontier model conducted pursuant to the large frontier developer’s frontier AI framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The results of those assessments.</p>

SB 53 requires much less than the Report recommends on this score.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D) Other steps taken to fulfill the requirements of the frontier AI framework with respect to the frontier model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A frontier developer that publishes the information described in paragraph (1) or (2) as part of a larger document, including a system card or model card, shall be deemed in compliance with the applicable paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A frontier developer is encouraged, but not required, to make disclosures described in this subdivision that are consistent with, or superior to, industry best practices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Office of Emergency Services shall take all necessary precautions to limit access to any reports related to internal use of frontier models to only personnel with a specific need to know the information and to protect the reports from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>(c) (1) Subject to paragraph (2), a frontier developer shall report any critical safety incident pertaining to one or more of its frontier models to the Office of Emergency Services within 15 days of discovering the critical safety incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If a frontier developer discovers that a critical safety incident poses an imminent risk of death or serious physical injury, the frontier developer shall disclose that incident within 24 hours to an authority, including any law enforcement agency or public safety agency with jurisdiction, that is appropriate based on the nature of that incident and as required by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A frontier developer that discovers information about a critical safety incident after filing the initial report required by this subdivision may file an amended report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A frontier developer is encouraged, but not required, to report critical safety incidents pertaining to foundation models that are not frontier models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) After a frontier developer has declared its intent pursuant to paragraph (1), both of the following apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The frontier developer shall be deemed in compliance with this section to the extent that the frontier developer meets the standards of, or complies with the requirements imposed or stated by, the designated federal law, regulation, or guidance document until the frontier developer declares the revocation of that intent to the Office of Emergency Services or the Office of Emergency Services revokes a relevant regulation pursuant to subdivision (j).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The failure by a frontier developer to meet the standards of, or comply with the requirements stated by, the federal law, regulation, or guidance document designated pursuant to subdivision (h) shall constitute a violation of this chapter.</p>

<p>Chapter 5.1 (commencing with Section 1107) is added to Part 3 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, to read:</p>
<p><h3>CHAPTER  5.1. Whistleblower Protections: Catastrophic Risks in AI Foundation Models</h3></p>
<p><em></em>1107.<em></em> For purposes of this chapter:</p>
<p>(a) (1) “Catastrophic risk” means a foreseeable and material risk that a frontier developer’s development, storage, use, or deployment of a foundation model will materially contribute to the death of, or serious injury to, more than 50 people or more than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000) in damage to, or loss of, property arising from a single incident involving a foundation model doing any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Providing expert-level assistance in the creation or release of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Engaging in conduct with no meaningful human oversight, intervention, or supervision that is either a cyberattack or, if committed by a human, would constitute the crime of murder, assault, extortion, or theft, including theft by false pretense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) “Catastrophic risk” does not include a foreseeable and material risk from any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Information that a foundation model outputs if the information is otherwise publicly accessible in a substantially similar form from a source other than a foundation model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Lawful activity of the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Harm caused by a foundation model in combination with other software where the foundation model did not materially contribute to the harm.</p>
<p>(b) “<span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_8732d7d3">Covered employee</span>” means an employee responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_8732d7d3" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">SB 53 only grants new whistleblower protections to a remarkably narrow group of people—namely, formal employees of frontier developers who have explicit responsibility for risk management. Independent contractors, unpaid advisors, board members, and staff of external evaluators don't count. Neither do researchers or engineers employed by a frontier developer whose job responsibilities don't include risk management. All of these people could plausibly have access to private information indicating a catastrophic risk, but SB 53 does nothing to strengthen their whistleblower rights.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(c) “Critical safety incident” means any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unauthorized access to, modification of, or exfiltration of the model weights of a foundation model that results in death, bodily injury, or damage to, or loss of, property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Harm resulting from the materialization of a catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Loss of control of a foundation model causing death or bodily injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A foundation model that uses deceptive techniques against the frontier developer to subvert the controls or monitoring of its frontier developer outside of the context of an evaluation designed to elicit this behavior and in a manner that demonstrates materially increased catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>(d) “Foundation model” has the meaning defined in Section 22757.11 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>(e) “Frontier developer” has the meaning defined in Section 22757.11 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>(f) “Large frontier developer” has the meaning defined in Section 22757.11 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p><em></em>1107.1.<em></em></p>
<p>(a) A frontier developer shall not make, adopt, enforce, or enter into a rule, regulation, policy, or contract that prevents a covered employee from disclosing, or retaliates against a covered employee for disclosing, information to the Attorney General, a federal authority, a person with authority over the covered employee, or another covered employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if the covered employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses either of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The frontier developer’s activities <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_67ed395f">pose a specific and substantial danger</span> to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_67ed395f" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This provision protects whistleblowers who come forward with evidence that a large frontier developer's activities pose a catastrophic risk. Before SB 53, California law only protected disclosures of evidence that an employer's activities break (federal, state, or local) law.<br><br>Many ways that a developer could cause a catastrophic risk would also involve breaking the law, but a developer could in principle do something catastrophically dangerous yet legal. This provision could also give AI whistleblowers more confidence to exercise their rights, since it may be easier for a would-be whistleblowers to tell whether their employer is causing a catastrophic risk than to tell whether their employer is breaking a specific law.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The frontier developer has violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>(b) A frontier developer shall not enter into a contract that prevents a covered employee from making a <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_2b97d305">disclosure protected under Section 1102.5</span>.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_2b97d305" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body"><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=1102.5" target="_blank">§1102.5</a> of the California Labor Code says that an employer may not make a rule against employees disclosing violations of federal, state, or local law to public officials or to their superiors. Further, it forbids an employer from retaliating against an employee who makes such a disclosure.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(c) A covered employee may use the hotline described in Section 1102.7 to make reports described in subdivision (a).</p>
<p>(d) A frontier developer shall <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_564f2c30">provide a clear notice</span> to all covered employees of their rights and responsibilities under this section, including by doing either of the following:<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_564f2c30" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Existing California law (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1102.8.&nodeTreePath=3.3.14&lawCode=LAB" target="_blank">§1102.8</a> of the Labor Code) already requires every employer in the state to post a notice somewhere in the workplace to inform employees of their whistleblower rights. Subsection 2 goes further, requiring a frontier developer to send every covered employee an annual notice of their rights. This second, stronger requirement does not apply to other employees under generic whistleblower law.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) At all times posting and displaying within any workplace maintained by the frontier developer a notice to all covered employees of their rights under this section, ensuring that any new covered employee receives equivalent notice, and ensuring that any covered employee who works remotely periodically receives an equivalent notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At least once each year, providing written notice to each covered employee of the covered employee’s rights under this section and ensuring that the notice is received and acknowledged by all of those covered employees.</p>
<p>(e) (1) A large frontier developer shall provide a reasonable internal process through which a covered employee may anonymously disclose information to the large frontier developer if the covered employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large frontier developer’s activities present a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the large frontier developer violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, including a monthly update to the person who made the disclosure regarding the status of the large frontier developer’s investigation of the disclosure and the actions taken by the large frontier developer in response to the disclosure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the disclosures and responses of the process required by this subdivision shall be shared with officers and directors of the large frontier developer at least once each quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) If a covered employee has alleged wrongdoing by an officer or director of the large frontier developer in a disclosure or response, subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to that officer or director.</p>
<p>(f) The court is authorized to award reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation of this section.</p>
<p>(g) In a civil action brought pursuant to this section, once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an activity proscribed by this section was a contributing factor in the alleged prohibited action against the covered employee, the frontier developer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the covered employee had not engaged in activities protected by this section.</p>
<p>(h) (1) In a civil action or administrative proceeding brought pursuant to this section, a covered employee may petition the superior court in any county wherein the violation in question is alleged to have occurred, or wherein the person resides or transacts business, for appropriate temporary or preliminary injunctive relief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon the filing of the petition for injunctive relief, the petitioner shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction to grant temporary injunctive relief as the court deems just and proper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In addition to any harm resulting directly from a violation of this section, the court shall consider the chilling effect on other covered employees asserting their rights under this section in determining whether temporary injunctive relief is just and proper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Appropriate injunctive relief shall be issued on a showing that reasonable cause exists to believe a violation has occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An order authorizing temporary injunctive relief shall remain in effect until an administrative or judicial determination or citation has been issued, or until the completion of a review pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 98.74, whichever is longer, or at a certain time set by the court. Thereafter, a preliminary or permanent injunction may be issued if it is shown to be just and proper. Any temporary injunctive relief shall not prohibit a frontier developer from disciplining or terminating a covered employee for conduct that is unrelated to the claim of the retaliation.</p>
<p>(i) Notwithstanding Section 916 of the Code of Civil Procedure, injunctive relief granted pursuant to this section shall not be stayed pending appeal.</p>
<p>(j) (1) This section does not impair or limit the applicability of Section 1102.5, including with respect to the rights of employees who are not covered employees to report violations of this chapter or Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The remedies provided by this section are cumulative to each other and the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.</p>
<p><em></em>1107.2.<em></em></p>
<p>The loss of value of equity does not count as damage to or loss of property for the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"><span class="section-number">SECTION 5.</span></h2>
<p>(a) The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.</p>
<p>(b) This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>

<p>(d) This act shall not apply to the extent that it strictly conflicts with the terms of a contract between a federal government entity and a frontier developer.</p>
<p>(e) This act shall not apply to the extent that it is <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_b54e88bd">preempted by federal law</span>.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_b54e88bd" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">The federal government came close to passing such a preemption in summer 2025. A draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the House <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/07/ai-congress-bill-state-ban-what-next?lang=en" target="_blank">would have banned</a> state and local governments from "regulating AI models, systems, or automated decision systems” for ten years.

<p>(f) This act preempts any rule, regulation, code, ordinance, or other law adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency on or after January 1, 2025, specifically related to the regulation of frontier developers with respect to their management of catastrophic risk.</p>

<p>The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which adds Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:</p>
<p>Information in critical safety incident reports, assessments of risks from internal use, and reports from covered employees may contain information that could threaten public safety or compromise the response to an incident if disclosed to the public.</p>
