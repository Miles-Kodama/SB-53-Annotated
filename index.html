<h2 class="section-heading"><span class="section-number">SECTION 1.</span></h2>
<p>The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
<p>(a) California is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and research through companies large and small and through the state’s remarkable public and private universities.</p>
<p>(b) Artificial intelligence, including new advances in foundation models, has the potential to catalyze innovation and the rapid development of a wide range of benefits for Californians and the California economy, including advances in medicine, wildfire forecasting and prevention, and climate science, and to push the bounds of human creativity and capacity.</p>
<p>(c) The <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_10b06d92">Joint California Policy Working Group</span> on AI Frontier Models has recommended sound principles for policy in artificial intelligence.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_10b06d92" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This refers to a group of AI experts <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advance-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/" target="_blank">convened</a> by Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2024 to study how California should govern frontier AI. The Working Group was led by Stanford HAI co-director <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/people/fei-fei-li" target="_blank">Fei-Fei Li</a>, Carnegie Endowment president <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/people/mariano-florentino-tino-cuellar?lang=en" target="_blank">Tino Cuéllar</a>, and UC Berkeley professor <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/people/jennifer-chayes" target="_blank">Jennifer Chayes</a>. They published their findings in June 2025 as the <a href="https://www.cafrontieraigov.org/" target="_blank">California Report on Frontier AI Policy.</a><br><br>SB 53's content draws heavily upon the California Report's recommendations, <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wiener-expands-ai-bill-landmark-transparency-measure-based-recommendations-governors" target="_blank">as noted</a> by the bill's author, Senator Scott Wiener.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(d) Targeted interventions to support effective artificial intelligence governance should balance the technology’s benefits and material risks.</p>
<p>(e) Artificial intelligence developers <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_b18dd661">have already voluntarily committed</span> to creating safety and security protocols and releasing the results of risk assessments.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_b18dd661" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">At the 2024 AI Summit in Seoul, most of America's leading AI companies voluntarily agreed to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024/frontier-ai-safety-commitments-ai-seoul-summit-2024" target="_blank">Frontier AI Safety Commitments</a>. Under these commitments each signatory must make a plan to assess and manage any severe risks their systems could pose (outcome 1), and they must disclose the results of their risk assessments to their home government (outcome 3). OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are all signatories to the Seoul Commitments<br><br>Previously in 2023, top American AI developers agreed to the <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/" target="_blank">White House Voluntary Commitments on AI</a>. These developers committed to running pre-deployment safety and security tests on their models, including tests by external experts. They also committed to issuing public reports on their AI systems' "capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use." The White House Commitments are not legally binding regulations, and they rely on AI developers to self-enforce. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon all agreed to the White House Commitments.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(f) In building a robust and transparent evidence environment, policymakers can align incentives to simultaneously protect consumers, leverage industry expertise, and recognize leading safety practices.</p>
<p>(g) When industry actors conduct internal research on their technologies’ impacts, a significant information asymmetry can develop between those with privileged access to data and the broader public.</p>
<p>(h) Greater transparency, given current information deficits, can advance accountability, competition, and public trust.</p>
<p>(i) Whistleblower protections and public-facing information sharing are key instruments to increase transparency.</p>
<p>(j) <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_c8de846b">Adverse event reporting systems</span> enable monitoring of the post-deployment impacts of artificial intelligence.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_c8de846b" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Much like the FDA's <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers" target="_blank">Adverse Event Reporting System</a>, a database that records adverse symptoms suffered by patients on FDA-approved drugs. FAERS exists to help drug regulators identify rare or long-latency effects of drugs that might not have been detected in pre-market clinical trials.<br><br>Similarly, adverse event reporting systems for AI could help AI regulators identify undesirable properties of models that might not have been caught in pre-deployment safety testing.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(k) There is growing evidence that, unless they are developed with careful diligence and reasonable precaution, advanced artificial intelligence systems <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_247bbe70">could pose catastrophic risks</span> from both malicious uses and malfunctions, including <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_cf27cf30">artificial intelligence-enabled hacking</span>, <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_09e11f2a">biological attacks</span>, and <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_f74c61c6">loss of control</span>.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_247bbe70" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">For an overview of the evidence that advanced AI could cause a catastrophe, see §2 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-ai-safety-report-2025/international-ai-safety-report-2025#risks" target="_blank">International AI Safety Report</a>.</div></div><div id="annotation_cf27cf30" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Evaluations indicate that present day models are still too weak at offensive hacking to substantially uplift competent threat actors (see <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/evaluating-potential-cybersecurity-threats-of-advanced-ai/" target="_blank">Rodriguez et al.</a>), but this could change as frontier models gain more advanced <a href="https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard" target="_blank">coding skills</a> and <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/" target="_blank">autonomy</a>.</div></div><div id="annotation_09e11f2a" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">There has not yet been a documented bio attack meaningfully assisted by AI, but frontier LLMs already <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108" target="_blank">exceed human expert performance</a> on tests of dangerous biology knowledge, and they are continuing to improve.</div></div><div id="annotation_f74c61c6" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Loss of control generally refers to scenarios where an AI system autonomously takes actions against its user's intent or wishes, and the user cannot correct the system or shut it down.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(l) With the frontier of artificial intelligence rapidly evolving, there is a need for legislation to track the frontier of artificial intelligence research and alert policymakers and the public to the risks and harms from the very most advanced artificial intelligence systems, while avoiding burdening smaller companies behind the frontier.</p>
<p>(m) A computational <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_30baf5ac">threshold of 10^26 floating point operations</span> captures the current frontier of foundation model development and captures only highly resourced developers spending <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_0857437f">hundreds of millions of dollars</span> to develop foundation models.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_30baf5ac" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">According to <a href="https://epoch.ai/data/notable-ai-models" target="_blank">Epoch AI's estimates</a>, no company had ever published a foundational model above this threshold until early 2025. Since then, only two companies (OpenAI and xAI) have released models that pass the threshold.<br><br>President Biden's <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-11-01/pdf/2023-24283.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order 14110</a> also used 10^26 training FLOPs as the threshold for a frontier model. Under EO 14110, any developer training a model above the threshold was required to disclose their safety testing results and security protocols to Federal authorities.</div></div><div id="annotation_0857437f" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This estimate is credible. A 10^26 FLOP training run on NVIDIA H100s at 50% utilization would require high tens of millions of GPU hours, which would cost over one hundred million dollars at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/gpus-pricing" target="_blank">current prices</a>.<br><br>For comparison, New York's proposed <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6453/amendment/A" target="_blank">RAISE Act</a> counts any person who has spent over five million dollars on a single training run as a large developer. SB 53's definition of a large developer is thus far more conservative than the RAISE ACt's threshold, and far less likely to burden small developers with unnecessary regulation.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(n) In the future, foundation models developed by <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_78a634c9">smaller companies or that are behind the frontier</span> may pose significant catastrophic risk, and additional legislation may be needed at that time.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_78a634c9" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">The main reason why companies behind the frontier could eventually pose catastrophic risk is algorithmic progress. Every year, machine learning researchers discover new ways to make their learning algorithms more efficient, allowing them to train a model with a given level of performance using fewer FLOPS than previously would have been needed. Epoch AI have estimated the rate of algorithmic progress for language models, and <a href="https://epoch.ai/blog/algorithmic-progress-in-language-models" target="_blank">they find</a> that from 2012 to 2023, the FLOPS required to achieve some fixed level of performance halved every eight months. If this trend holds, a model that takes 10^26 FLOPs to train now will take two orders of magnitude fewer FLOPs in five years.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(o) It is the intent of the Legislature to create more transparency, but collective safety will depend in part on large developers taking due care in their development and deployment of foundation models proportional to the scale of the foreseeable risks.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"><span class="section-number">SECTION 2.</span></h2>
<p>Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) is added to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, to read:</p>
<p><h3>CHAPTER  25.1. Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act</h3></p>
<p><h3>22757.10.</h3></p>
<p>This chapter shall be known as the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>
<p><h3>22757.11.</h3></p>
<p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>
<p>(a) “<span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_94241f20">Artificial intelligence model</span>” means an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_94241f20" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This definition is a close paraphrase of the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/explanatory-memorandum-on-the-updated-oecd-definition-of-an-ai-system_623da898-en.html" target="_blank">OECD's definition</a> of an AI system, published in March 2024.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(b) “Catastrophic risk” means a foreseeable and material risk that a large developer’s development, storage, use, or deployment of a foundation model will materially contribute to the death of, or serious injury to, more than <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_ac76a63f">100 people</span> or more than <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_27a514a8">one billion dollars</span> ($1,000,000,000) in damage to rights in money or property arising from a single incident, scheme, or course of conduct involving a dangerous capability.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_ac76a63f" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">An AI model could materially contribute to a mass casualty event by, for example, helping a bioterrorist to <a href="https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/ais-are-disseminating-expert-level-virology-skills" target="_blank">create a dangerous pathogen</a> or carrying out a <a href="https://safe.ai/blog/cybersecurity-and-ai-the-evolving-security-landscape" target="_blank">cyberattack on critical infrastructure</a>.</div></div><div id="annotation_27a514a8" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">An AI model could materially contribute to a billion dollars of economic loss by assisting in the creation or release of a pathogen that causes a major epidemic. The economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated at <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7604733/" target="_blank">over ten trillion dollars</a>, so even an epidemic four orders of magnitude less severe would count as catastrophic by this definition. A model could also cause a billion dollars of loss through mass cybercrime, for instance, by spreading <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/" target="_blank">self-replicating ransomware</a> or by <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2024-11-12-rogue-replication-threat-model/" target="_blank">autonomously scamming</a> people on a massive scale.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(c) “Critical safety incident” means any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unauthorized access to, modification of, or exfiltration of, the model weights of a foundation model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Harm resulting from the materialization of a catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Loss of control of a foundation model causing death, bodily injury, or damage to rights in money or property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A foundation model that uses <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_ee598428">deceptive techniques</span> against the large developer to subvert the controls or monitoring of its large developer outside of the context of an evaluation designed to elicit this behavior.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_ee598428" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">For instance, a model could hide its true desires and motivations from its developers in hopes of protecting those desires from modification. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking" target="_blank">Greenblatt et al.</a> observed this behavior in Claude 3 Opus in their "Alignment Faking in Large Language Models" experiment.<br><br>A model might also intentionally underperform on capabilities tests, either because it was deliberately trained to do so by its developers, or because the model wants to hide its full capabilities from its own developers. This behavior is usually called "sandbagging," and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07358v2" target="_blank">van der Weij et al.</a> have demonstrated that frontier models were already capable of sophisticated sandbagging in mid-2024.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(d) “<span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_7b7ca9d1">Dangerous capability</span>” means the capacity of a foundation model to do any of the following:<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_7b7ca9d1" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This definition of dangerous capabilities aligns with definitions found in the scientific literature. See, for instance, foundational papers by <a href="https://deepmind.google/research/publications/78150/" target="_blank">Phuong et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/model-evaluation-for-extreme-risks" target="_blank">Shevlane et al.</a><br><br>The ability to persuade or manipulate humans is also sometimes considered a dangerous model capability. Capabilities (3) and (4) below could implicitly include dangerous persuasion.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide expert-level assistance in the creation or release of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Conduct or assist in a cyberattack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Engage in conduct, with limited human intervention, that would, if committed by a human, constitute the crime of extortion, theft, including theft by deception, or a serious or violent felony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Evade the control of its large developer or user.</p>
<p>(e) (1) “<span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_fc42f192">Deploy</span>” means to make a foundation model available to a third party for use, modification, copying, or combination with other software.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_fc42f192" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This definition counts both closed source releases—where users are allowed to query a model only through a web app or API—and open source releases—where users are given full access to a model's weights—as deployments.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) “Deploy” does not include making a foundation model available to a third party for the primary purpose of developing or evaluating the foundation model.</p>
<p>(f) “<span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_d224658b">Large developer</span>” means either of the following:<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_d224658b" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">SB 53 takes an <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/06/artificial-intelligence-regulation-united-states" target="_blank">entity-based</a> approach to AI regulation. Instead of regulating frontier models—as SB 1047 would have done—SB 53 regulates large developers. This entity-based approach may prove more robust than model-based approaches to unforeseen technical innovations. Model-based regulation requires regulators to set a threshold that determines which models are at the frontier, but such thresholds can rapidly become obsolete when training paradigms change. On the other hand, entity-based regulation avoids inadvertently burdening small or behind-the-frontier AI developers in the future because their models pass a threshold that <em>used</em> to indicate frontier capabilities.<br><br>New York's proposed <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6453/amendment/A" target="_blank">RAISE Act</a> is another prominent instance of entity-based AI regulation.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) (A) Before January 1, 2027, “large developer” means a person who has trained, or initiated the training of, at least one foundation model using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The quantity of computing power described in subparagraph (A) shall include computing for the original training run and any <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_fe7ccb25">subsequent fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, or other material modifications</span> to a preceding foundation model.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_fe7ccb25" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Fine-tuning and RL are often referred to as "post-training", a catch-all for the adjustments AI companies make to a model after an initial pre-training run. Post-training already consumes a significant share of a frontier training run's compute budget. <a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/grok-4-an-o3-look-alike-in-search" target="_blank">xAI claims</a> that more than half of the FLOPs used to train Grok 4 were spent on RL.

Broadly, the tracked categories (§2.2) are more easily measurable or tie into better established threat models. OpenAI's tracked categories are biological and chemical capabilities, cybersecurity capabilities, and AI self-improvement. The research categories are broadly capabilities that OpenAI considers harder to measure or more speculative, and they include long-range autonomy, sandbagging, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11671" target="_blank">autonomous replication and adaptation</a>, undermining safeguards, and nuclear and radiological capabilities.

The Policy calls for Anthropic to take a "defense in depth" strategy, layering many mechanisms to catch attempted misuse on top of one another, and to rapidly patch jailbreaks and other vulnerabilities when they become known.

The safeguards put on a model will depend on which capability thresholds the model crosses, and they are intended to reduce risks both from misuse by a malicious user and from misaligned models acting autonomously. OpenAI's list of safeguards includes refusal training, usage monitoring, and tiered access to prevent malicious misuse, as well as alignment training, autonomy hobbling, and automated oversight to prevent attacks by misaligned models. OpenAI's Safety Advisory Group—an internal committee responsible for enforcing the Preparedness Framework—is tasked with assessing whether the safeguards OpenAI has put on a model are reducing risk to an acceptable level. The Group makes this assessment on the basis of evaluations, threat modeling, and a review of the baseline risk caused by other developers' models, and they explain their reasoning in an internal report. </li><br><li>Google DeepMind's <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/Frontier%20Safety%20Framework%202.0.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">Frontier Safety Framework</a> says that they will mitigate the risk caused by their systems through both security and deployment mitigations.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The degree to which the large developer’s assessments of catastrophic risk and the effectiveness of catastrophic risk mitigations are reproducible by external entities.</p>

The Policy further says that external experts will help Anthropic determine when to activate <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/activating-asl3-protections" target="_blank">ASL-3 security standards</a> and help them verify that they have achieved ASL-3 standards (§§3.3 & 4.3).</li><br><li>OpenAI's <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/18a02b5d-6b67-4cec-ab64-68cdfbddebcd/preparedness-framework-v2.pdf#page=14" target="_blank">Preparedness Framework</a> says they will work with third parties to further evaluate a model's dangerous capabilities "if we deem that a deployment warrants deeper testing of [those capabilities]." Similarly, OpenAI says they will have third parties assess their deployment safeguards if they deem it necessary and "if high quality third-party testing is available." they also allow their Safety Advisory Group—the internal committee responsible for enforcing the Preparedness Framework—may solicit independent expert advice if they wish.

The Framework says Google "may use additional external evaluators to test a model for relevant capabilities, if evaluators with relevant expertise are needed to provide an additional signal about a model’s proximity to [dangerous capability thresholds]."

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The testing procedures that the large developer will use to assess and manage a <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_2011353a">catastrophic risk resulting from the internal use</span> of its foundation models, including risks resulting from a foundation model circumventing oversight mechanisms, and the schedule, specified in days, by which the large developer will report these assessments pursuant to subdivision (d).<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_2011353a" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">That is, catastrophic risk resulting from a large developer using a model that has not yet been publicly deployed. Even before deployment, a model is vulnerable to theft by malicious outside actors and to catastrophic misuse by the developer's own staff. More speculatively, if a developer used a powerful misaligned model internally on sensitive engineering tasks, the model might strategically sabotage those tasks, causing a catastrophe at some later point. A misaligned model might also attempt to exfiltrate its own weights from the developer's computers before it is intentionally deployed. (Scientists have <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking" target="_blank">already observed</a> models attempting to self-exfiltrate in controlled evaluations.)<br><br>For more analysis of risks from internal use of AI models, see "<a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-01-17-ai-models-dangerous-before-public-deployment/" target="_blank">AI models can be dangerous before public deployment</a>" by METR and "<a href="https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/ai-behind-closed-doors-a-primer-on-the-governance-of-internal-deployment" target="_blank">AI Behind Closed Doors</a>" by Apollo Research.</div></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) How the developer determines when its foundation models are substantially <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_22740de4">modified enough to conduct additional assessments</span> and publish a transparency report pursuant to subdivision (c).<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_22740de4" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">AI developers will often make modifications to an AI system after its initial public deployment.

This requirement could trigger when a major post-deployment update is made to a model, when the model's "use and/or integrations" change materially, or when a serious incident "involving the model or a similar model" occurs. In general, the EU Code of Practice requires more active updates to transparency reports than SB 53 would require.<br><br>OpenAI has already <a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/eu-code-of-practice/" target="_blank">announced its intention</a> to sign the AI Act Code of Practice voluntarily.</div></div><div id="annotation_23a67e94" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">The transparency report required by SB 53 is similar to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993" target="_blank">model card</a>, a report that most frontier AI developers voluntarily publish each time they release a new model.

This creates a gap between the capabilities measured by the evaluator and the theoretical ceiling on the capabilities that could be elicited in the field. The evaluator might not have observed some dangerous capability in the model, but that's only because they didn't sample it enough times or give it a sufficiently optimized prompt, not because the model's capabilities are inherently limited. <br><br>If a frontier developer discloses the time and extent of pre-deployment access granted to third-party evaluators, it will be easier for the external scientific community to estimate the size of any elicitation gap that might make the model more dangerous than it appears.</div></div></div></p>

<p>(d) A large developer shall clearly and conspicuously publish on its internet website any assessment of catastrophic risk resulting from internal use of its foundation models pursuant to the schedule the developer specifies in its safety and security protocol.</p>
<p>(e) A large developer shall not make a <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_dc5c514b">materially false or misleading statement</span> about catastrophic risk from its foundation models or its management of catastrophic risk.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_dc5c514b" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">Some false or misleading statements about catastrophic risk management might already be penalized under existing law.<br><br>California's <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=7.&chapter=5.&part=2.&lawCode=BPC" target="_blank">Unfair Competition Law</a> already forbids businesses from making "unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading" claims about their products to consumers. If a large developer makes false or misleading statements to its users about catastrophic risks, it could thus expose itself to civil penalties under UCL. But UCL also has limitations. The fine for making a false or misleading statement is capped at $2,500, an extremely small figure compared to the losses a catastrophic risk would impose on society. And further, only private plaintiffs who have "suffered injury in fact" have standing to sue under UCL. This could make it practically challenging to sue a developer for making false or misleading statements before their model has actually caused a catastrophe.<br><br>Federal and state securities fraud laws could also ban certain false or misleading statements by developers. It is illegal under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2014-title17-vol4/pdf/CFR-2014-title17-vol4-sec240-10b-5.pdf" target="_blank">SEC Rule 10b-5</a> for a corporation "to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made…not misleading…in connection with the purchase or sale of any security." Rule 10b-5 could be used against developers who make false or misleading claims to investors about their catastrophic risk management. But this legal strategy relies on an untested interpretation of materiality, and it would only apply to public companies or companies actively engaged in selling securities.<br><br>Overall, it seems likely that paragraph (e) would expand large developers' legal liability for false or misleading safety claims.</div></div></div></p>

<p><h3>22757.15.</h3></p>
<p>(a) On or before January 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, the Attorney General may adopt regulations to <span class="annotated" data-annotation-id="annotation_0e61d790">update the definition of a “large developer”</span> for the purposes of this chapter to ensure that it accurately reflects technological developments, scientific literature, and widely accepted national and international standards and applies to well-resourced large developers at the frontier of artificial intelligence development.<br><div class="paragraph-annotations"><div id="annotation_0e61d790" class="annotation-content"><div class="annotation-body">This allows the California Attorney General to adjust the training compute threshold for a person to count as a large developer upward or downward, or to replace it with a different kind of threshold altogether. For example, the compute threshold could be replaced with a cost threshold like the threshold used in New York's proposed <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A6453/amendment/A" target="_blank">RAISE Act</a>.</div></div></div></p>
<p>(b) In developing regulations pursuant to this section, the Attorney General shall take into account all of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Similar thresholds used in international standards or federal law, guidance, or regulations for the management of catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Input from stakeholders, including academics, industry, the open-source community, and governmental entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The extent to which a person will be able to determine, before beginning to train or deploy a foundation model, whether that person will be subject to the regulations as a large developer with an aim toward allowing earlier determinations if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The complexity of determining whether a person is covered, with an aim toward allowing simpler determinations if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The external verifiability of determining whether a person is covered, with an aim toward definitions that are verifiable by parties other than the large developer.</p>
<p>(c) If the Attorney General determines that less well-resourced developers, or developers significantly behind the frontier of artificial intelligence, may create substantial catastrophic risk, the Attorney General shall promptly submit a report to the Legislature, pursuant to Section 9795, with a proposal for managing this source of catastrophic risk but shall not include those developers within the definition of “large developer” without authorization in subsequently enacted legislation.</p>

Independent contractors, freelancers, and unpaid advisors are usually not treated as employees under normal employment law, but for purposes of this chapter, they do count. This ensures that virtually anyone within a frontier developer who could plausibly access privileged information about catastrophic risks gets whistleblower protection.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ai<em>whistleblower</em>protection_act.pdf" target="_blank">AI Whistleblower Protection Act</a> currently up for debate in the US Senate extends protection to a partially overlapping class of individuals.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The large developer’s activities pose a catastrophic risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The large developer has violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At least once each year, providing written notice to each employee of the employee’s rights under this section and ensuring that the notice is received and acknowledged by all of those employees.</p>
<p>(f) (1) A large developer shall provide a reasonable internal process through which an employee may anonymously disclose information to the large developer if the employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large developer’s activities present a catastrophic risk or that the large developer has violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, including a monthly update to the person who made the disclosure regarding the status of the large developer’s investigation of the disclosure and the actions taken by the large developer in response to the disclosure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the disclosures and responses of the process required by this subdivision shall be shared with officers and directors of the large developer at least once each quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) If an employee has alleged wrongdoing by an officer or director of the large developer in a disclosure or response, subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to that officer or director.</p>
<p>(g) The court is authorized to award reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation of this section.</p>
<p>(h) In a civil action brought pursuant to this section, once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an activity proscribed by this section was a contributing factor in the alleged prohibited action against the employee, the large developer shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the employee had not engaged in activities protected by this section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon the filing of the petition for injunctive relief, the petitioner shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction to grant temporary injunctive relief as the court deems just and proper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In addition to any harm resulting directly from a violation of this section, the court shall consider the chilling effect on other employees asserting their rights under this section in determining whether temporary injunctive relief is just and proper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Appropriate injunctive relief shall be issued on a showing that reasonable cause exists to believe a violation has occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An order authorizing temporary injunctive relief shall remain in effect until an administrative or judicial determination or citation has been issued, or until the completion of a review pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 98.74, whichever is longer, or at a certain time set by the court. Thereafter, a preliminary or permanent injunction may be issued if it is shown to be just and proper. Any temporary injunctive relief shall not prohibit a large developer from disciplining or terminating an employee for conduct that is unrelated to the claim of the retaliation.</p>
<p>(j) Notwithstanding Section 916 of the Code of Civil Procedure, injunctive relief granted pursuant to this section shall not be stayed pending appeal.</p>
<p>(k) (1) This section does not impair or limit the applicability of Section 1102.5.</p>
